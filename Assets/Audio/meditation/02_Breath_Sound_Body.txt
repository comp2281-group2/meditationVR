So you can find your meditation posture#5
Sitting in a way that’s neither too tight nor too relaxed#5
But comfortable and upright#5
Then notice your body from the inside#3
Noticing the shape and the weight and the touch#7
And areas you make contact with the floor or the chair#11
Then you can focus on your breathing#4
Feeling your breath#3
In the area of either the abdomen, chest, or nostrils#12
Feeling the gentle rising and falling of your abdomen or chest#7
Or the coolness and in and out sensations at your nostrils#12
So the breath is our anchor#3
It’s where we establish our awareness#5
It helps us have something to always return to#5
This simple act of breathing#6
Now you might notice that other things pull your attention away from the breath#7
And that might be sound#6
So right now, just for a moment#3
Bring your attention to the sounds#3
Inside the room#2
Or outside the room#6
Simply listening#3
They might be pleasant sounds, unpleasant sounds#6
Listen to them with curiosity and interest#6
Noticing them coming and going#4
Without getting caught up in a story about what that sound is or why it’s there#7
Simply listening#5
Can also notice the sound of silence#25
And now letting go of this hearing#2
The listening#1
Bring your attention into your body#3
And notice if there are body sensations#4
To be aware of#4
There might be pressure or tightness#3
Or movement or vibration#3
Or heat or cold#3
Or tingling#4
Notice which sensations call out to you#3
And let your attention go to them#4
It might be a very strong and obvious sensation#7
There might be a soft or subtle sensation#9
You might notice yourself jumping from sensation to sensation#8
Or there may be one that grabs your attention and holds it#4
Particularly if it’s unpleasant#2
You might notice it#2
Is it growing or shrinking?#2
Moving#3
Does is pulse or throb#3
Ache#3
Just notice with curiosity#3
Similarly not making up a whole story about the experience#5
Just being directly with the sensations in your body#20
So now return to your breathing#4
Finding your breath#5
And as you continue on in this meditation#3
You’ll stay with your breath one breath at a time#6
If you notice yourself lost in thoughts you can say “thinking”#4
Or “wandering”#4
And then redirect your attention#2
Returning back to the breathing#5
Now if you find a sound#5
Or a body sensation#2
Become so obvious, strong#4
That you can’t, any longer, stay with the breath#3
Because it pulls your attention away#4
Then let yourself let go of the breath#3
And focus on the body sensation#4
Or sound#4
Listen to it or feel it#4
Until it no longer holds your attention#3
Or it’s stopped#6
At that point go back to the breathing#4
Returning to the simplicity of your anchor#5
The breath#6
We’ll try this for a few minutes in silence#251
Now once again notice your whole body sitting here#8
Tuning into the shape#4
The posture#2
The movement#4
Let yourself relax#8
And you can wish yourself well#8
May I be happy and at ease#5
May I be free from stress and anxiety#8
May I be peaceful#10
And let yourself consider the possibility#3
Of finding peace and ease#3
Wellbeing#10
