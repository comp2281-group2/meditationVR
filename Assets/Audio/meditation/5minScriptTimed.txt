Find a relaxed, comfortable position#3
Seated on a chair or on the floor, on a cushion#10
Keep your back upright, but not too tight#6
Hands resting wherever they're comfortable#6
Tongue on the roof of your mouth or wherever it's comfortable#7
And you can notice your body#3
From the inside#4
Noticing the shape of your body, the weight, touch#11
And let yourself relax#3
And become curious about your body#5
Seated here#1
The sensations of your body, the touch#6
The connection with the floor, the chair#7
Relax any areas of tightness or tension#5
Just breathe, soften#9
And now begin to tune into your breath#3
In your body#5
Feeling the natural flow of breath#7
Don't need to do anything to your breath#3
Not long not short just natural#5
And notice where you feel your breath in your body#11
It might be in your abdomen#3
It may be in your chest or throat#3
Or in your nostrils#5
See if you can feel the sensations of breath#5
One breath at a time#9
When one breath ends, the next breath begins#12
Now as you do this you might notice that your mind might start to wander#7
You might start thinking about other things#4
If this happens this is not a problem#3
It's very natural#3
Just notice that your mind has wandered#4
You can say "thinking" or "wandering" in your head softly#8
And then gently redirect your attention right back to the breathing#12
So we'll stay with this for some time in silence#4
Just a short time#4
Noticing our breath#2
From time to time getting lost in thought and returning to our breath#6
See if you can be really kind to yourself in the process#50
And once again you can notice your body, your whole body, seated here#10
Let yourself relax even more deeply#7
And then offer yourself some appreciation#4
For doing this practice today#5
Whatever that means to you#5
Finding a sense of ease and wellbeing for yourself and this day#20
